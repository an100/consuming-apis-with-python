**How to Consume APIs Using Python**

Excited about the incredible array of APIs but don't know how to use them? Although APIs serve many purposes, there are common approaches to consuming them that you will learn in this workshop. We will survey the many types of available APIs while concentrating on a few important examples of them. In this workshop, we will use Python, a commonly used and powerful language for working with APIs. Even if you don't know Python, you'll pick up some basic concepts that will serve you well on your journey of API consumption.
